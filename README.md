## 👋 Hi there, I’m Danendra Sajana Dhika

🎯 I’m a **Data Analyst Intern at PT Gunung Raja Paksi**, where I analyze logistics and inventory systems by developing dashboards, writing complex SQL queries, and collaborating with stakeholders to deliver insights that support strategic decisions.

📘 I’m currently a student at **Universitas Negeri Jakarta**, majoring in **Systems and Information Technology**, and have completed a rigorous 6-month **Data Analyst bootcamp at RevoU**, where I tackled real-world projects in sales, health, and operations data.

🛠️ I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights from data cleaning and transformation to exploratory analysis and dashboard visualization with a strong focus on accuracy, efficiency, and business impact.

💬 Always open to discussing data workflows, analytics projects, and opportunities to collaborate on meaningful data solutions.
